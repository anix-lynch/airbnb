   - Analyzed null values and dropped the `filter_neighborhoods` column.
   - Converted date columns to datetime format for better manipulation.
   - Created new columns like `length_preperation` to determine how soon guests book before their check-in date.

2. **Distribution Analysis:**
   - Visualized distributions of variables like `n_guests_min`, `n_guests_max`, `filter_price_max`, and `length_preperation`.
   - Analyzed the timing of searches and bookings, focusing on preparation time and night stays.
   - Filtered and visualized searches based on price constraints and duration of stay.

3. **Contacts Dataset:**
   - Converted date columns to datetime and identified whether a booking was accepted.
   - Analyzed the number of guests, conversion rates, and seasonal trends in booking acceptance.

4. **Merged Analysis:**
   - Merged `contacts` and `searches` datasets for comprehensive analysis.
   - Compared maximum prices searched between accepted and rejected applications.
   - Classified searches based on price ranges and analyzed acceptance rates.
   - Determined acceptance rates by origin country, visualizing the results.

#### **Assignment Questions Answered:**

1. **What guests are searching for in Dublin:**
   - Guests are primarily interested in searches within a specific price range (mostly under 600), room types, and the number of nights. Many searches are conducted months in advance, indicating planned trips.
   - Visualizations showed that guests look for rooms for varied numbers of nights and prepare in advance, typically not exceeding a hundred days before check-in.

2. **Which inquiries hosts tend to accept:**
   - Hosts tend to accept inquiries that fall within a reasonable price range (under 600) and from certain countries with higher acceptance rates.
   - The acceptance rate varies by country, with some countries showing a higher acceptance rate, especially when the price is within an acceptable range.

3. **Gaps between guest demand and host supply to increase bookings:**
   - There is a noticeable gap in higher price ranges; inquiries over 600 are less likely to be accepted.
   - Seasonal trends indicate higher acceptance during certain months, suggesting opportunities to balance demand and supply by promoting availability in less busy periods.
   - Understanding specific needs such as the number of guests and room types can help in tailoring listings to meet demand more effectively.

4. **Other useful data to deepen the analysis:**
   - More detailed guest demographics and preferences (e.g., length of stay, specific amenities).
   - Host responses and feedback, reasons for rejection or acceptance.
   - Competitive analysis with data from similar cities or markets to understand broader trends.
   - Reviews and ratings to correlate with acceptance and booking success rates.

### Summary:
The analysis provided valuable insights into guest behavior and host acceptance patterns in Dublin. Understanding these trends allows for strategic adjustments to better meet guest demands, optimize listings, and ultimately increase bookings. Further data could enhance this analysis, providing a deeper understanding of the market dynamics.
